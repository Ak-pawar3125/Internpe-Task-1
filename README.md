# Internpe-Task-1(Number Guessing Game)

This project is a simple Number Guessing Game implemented in Java as part of my internship at InternPe. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the correct number with hints provided after each incorrect guess. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number and has the option to play again.
<br>
# How the Game Works?
<br>
-The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
<br>
-The user is prompted to guess the number.
<br>
-The program provides feedback:
<br>
-If the guess is too low, it informs the user.
<br>
-If the guess is too high, it informs the user.
<br>
-If the guess is correct, it congratulates the user and displays the number of attempts taken.
<br>
-The user is then given an option to play again or exit the game.

# features :
<br>
-Random number generation using java.util.Random.
<br>
-User input handling via java.util.Scanner.
<br>
-Loop-based gameplay to allow multiple attempts.
<br>
-Option to replay after winning.<br>
